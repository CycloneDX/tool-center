# CycloneDX Tool Center

The CycloneDX Tool Center is the largest publicly available collection of SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) and xBOM (e.g., SaaSBOM, CBOM, HBOM) products, projects, and services. It serves as a centralized resource for anyone looking to explore, evaluate, or integrate BOM-related capabilities into their toolchains and workflows. The Tool Center is an integral part of the [CycloneDX website](https://cyclonedx.org).

As of March 2025, the CycloneDX Tool Center leverages a JSON Schema in which `tools.json` must validate against. [View the human-readable documentation for the JSON Schema](https://cyclonedx.github.io/tool-center/).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you know of a tool, product, or service related to SBOM or xBOM (SaaSBOM, CBOM, HBOM) that isn’t listed, please feel free to open a pull request or file an issue. When contributing, ensure that:

- The tool is relevant to SBOM/xBOM generation, analysis, or consumption.
- Any provided metadata or descriptions are accurate and up-to-date.
- Licensing and attribution requirements for tools are respected.

Editing the `tools.json` file manually can be complicated. An alternative is to use
[MetaConfigurator](https://metaconfigurator.github.io/meta-configurator/?schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CycloneDX/tool-center/refs/heads/main/tools.schema.json&data=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CycloneDX/tool-center/refs/heads/main/tools.json&settings=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CycloneDX/tool-center/refs/heads/tools-editor/metaConfiguratorSettings.json) to make changes then download the edited data.
